 I am currently a Sophmore at The University Of The People, getting my bachelors in Computer Science. 
 I'm currently a Web Developer at Super Purposes, but open to Software Engineering internships, or any Front End Developer roles.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a photography portfolio using CSS Animations, Javascript, and HTML.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Jquery.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my projects, I am always happy to talk about them and receive feedback.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me on linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandra-landa-moya-aa2476109/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a background in Sales, realized I did not like people as much as I like coding.
